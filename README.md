# COMPSCI1012 Scientific Computing I
This course provides an introduction to basic computer programming concepts and techniques useful for Scientists, Mathematicians and Engineers. The course exposes students to practical applications of computing and commonly used tools within these domains. It introduces techniques for problem solving, program design and algorithm development. MATLAB (approximately 24 lectures): Basic programming: introduction to the MATLAB environment and the MATLAB help system, data types and scalar variables, arithmetic and mathematical functions, input and output, selection and iteration statements. Functions: user defined functions, function files, passing information to and from functions, function design and program decomposition, recursion. Arrays: vectors, arrays and matrices, array addressing, vector, matrix and element-by-element operations. Graphics: 2-D and 3-D plotting. Mathematical modelling: dynamical systems, linear systems, numerical differentiation and integration. Spreadsheets (approximately 6 lectures): Spreadsheets as a tool for Scientific Computing: calculation, using in-built functions, plotting and fitting, modelling and optimisation using the Goal-Seek and Solver tools, data analysis.
